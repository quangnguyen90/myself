              <p> <span class="dropcap">I</span> always want to make simple & different software products by myself to help people in their life.
                  I learn every days to get more experiences as much as possible & think a lot about my career path: Who will I become to in the future? What will I have to do ? What will I get ?
                  </p>

              <p> After graduated from my Van Lang university, major in Software engineering (based on Canergie Mellon University program), my first objective is become project 
                  manager. So that, I have been started to research & read a lot of newspaper about economical, successfull people, unique ideas, human resource management, etc to 
                  promote my passion on IT. I also imporve my technical skill, soft skill because it's my current working & enjoy learn new things when I have free time.
              </p>

              <p> <span class="dropcap">M</span> oreover, I also have a passion on music. I can play cajon drum, harmonica, guitar, flute, ukulele & I am learning keyboard, also. It helps me relax when I feel stress & tired. 
                  I believe that playing instruments & working IT will make me become more confident. Music make us sometime have some unique ideas, logic better, open mind & think different. 
                  I am not lucky as many people when I was born with a weakness health, I know that there are many people who have worse status than me, but some of them still
                  beome successfull people and make a lot of others know them. Therefore, life is only once & no one have to live for the other's life, I believe that with all the passion & ambitous in IT, I will become 
                  a successfull people.
                </p>
